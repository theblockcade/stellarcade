# Multi-Player Room Contract

## Overview

The Multi-Player Room contract manages room lifecycle for multi-player game sessions on Stellarcade.
It provides deterministic state transitions and consistent event emission for room creation,
player enrollment, match start, and room closure.
Each room now carries its own capacity, and the contract exposes a lobby-friendly snapshot
accessor so UIs can render occupancy and host metadata without chaining multiple reads.

## Lifecycle

`Open -> InMatch -> Closed`

- `create_room` creates a room in `Open` state.
- `create_room` configures the room capacity at creation time.
- `join_room` is allowed only in `Open`.
- `start_match` transitions `Open` to `InMatch` when minimum player count is met.
- `close_room` transitions `Open` or `InMatch` to `Closed`.

## Public Interface

### `init(admin, fee_contract)`

Initializes contract-level configuration and can only be called once.

### `create_room(room_id, config_hash)`

Admin-only room creation.

### `join_room(room_id, player)`

Player joins an open room; player must authorize.

### `start_match(room_id)`

Admin-only transition from `Open` to `InMatch`. Requires at least 2 players.

### `close_room(room_id)`

Admin-only transition to `Closed`.

## Additional View Methods

- `get_room(room_id) -> RoomData`
- `room_snapshot(room_id) -> RoomSnapshot`
- `get_players(room_id) -> Vec<Address>`
- `get_fee_contract() -> Address`

## Events

- `Initialized { admin, fee_contract }`
- `RoomCreated { room_id, config_hash, created_by }`
- `PlayerJoined { room_id, player, player_count }`
- `MatchStarted { room_id, player_count }`
- `RoomClosed { room_id, final_player_count }`

## Storage

### Instance keys

- `Admin: Address`
- `FeeContract: Address`
- `Paused: bool`

### Persistent keys

- `Room(room_id): RoomData`
- `RoomPlayers(room_id): Vec<Address>`
- `PlayerInRoom(room_id, player): bool`

## Room Snapshot

`room_snapshot(room_id)` returns a compact view with `occupancy`, `capacity`, `remaining_slots`,
`status`, `config_hash`, and `host` so lobbies can render a room card without extra reads.

## Validation and Security

- Privileged methods require admin authorization (`create_room`, `start_match`, `close_room`).
- `join_room` requires player authorization.
- Duplicate joins and duplicate room IDs are rejected.
- Invalid/zero `room_id` and zeroed `config_hash` are rejected.
- `create_room` rejects a zero capacity and any capacity above the global limit.
- State transitions are guarded and deterministic.
- Arithmetic uses checked operations for player count updates.
- Emergency pause guard exists via `Paused` instance flag.

## Invariants

- A room ID can be created only once.
- Room status can never move backward.
- A player can join a room at most once.
- `player_count == len(RoomPlayers(room_id))` for all successful transitions.

## Integration Assumptions

- `fee_contract` address is stored for downstream composition with fee/accounting contracts.
- No external contract call is made in this contract yet; orchestration is expected in higher-level game contracts.
- Emergency controls may set `Paused` via integrated admin tooling/contract governance.

## Test Coverage

Unit tests cover:

- Initialization and re-initialization guard
- Happy-path lifecycle and final state
- Unauthorized privileged method calls
- Duplicate create/join actions
- Invalid state transitions
- Invalid input rejection
- Paused/emergency guard behavior
- Event emission presence for lifecycle operations
