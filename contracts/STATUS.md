# Contract Status

An honest, current classification of every contract crate in this workspace,
generated 2026-08-10. `CLAUDE.md`'s existing status table predates this and
is **stale** — it was written when the repo had no workspace `Cargo.toml`
and described `coin-flip`/`prize-pool`/`random-generator` as stubs. All
three are now substantial (400–1450 lines) with real logic. That table
should be updated or removed the next time someone touches `CLAUDE.md`.

## Methodology (and its limits)

151 crates were scanned programmatically:

- Line count of `src/lib.rs`
- Presence of `todo!()` / `unimplemented!()` / literal `TODO` comments
- Presence of `#[test]` blocks (a proxy for test coverage, not quality)
- Explicit placeholder language (`"for now"`, `"would be populated"`,
  `"empty state"`, `"placeholder"`, `"not yet implement"`) — this caught
  contracts like `clan-registry` that compile and have real-looking
  `#[contractimpl]` blocks but return hardcoded zero/empty structs

**This is a heuristic, not a manual code review of 151 crates** — some
classifications are almost certainly wrong at the margins (see
`leaderboard` below for one caught-and-corrected example). Treat this as a
starting map, not ground truth; re-classify a crate by hand before relying
on its status for a real decision.

Rule:
- **stub** — <70 lines, OR contains placeholder language
- **implemented** — has `#[test]` blocks, ≥150 lines, zero `todo!`/`TODO`
- **partial** — everything else (real logic present, but untested and/or
  has open `TODO`s and/or under the "implemented" size bar)

## Results

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| implemented | 39 |
| partial | 78 |
| stub | 34 |

## Build health (found and fixed during this audit)

**The entire workspace failed to resolve its dependency graph before this
pass** — `cargo check --workspace` errored on a `curve25519-dalek` version
conflict before compiling a single crate. Root cause: 8 near-empty stub
crates (`arena-reserves`, `badge-claims-v2`, `badge-ledger`,
`ladder-payouts`, `payout-checkpoints`, `raffle-escrow`, `sponsor-payouts`,
`treasury-streams` — all under 55 lines) were pinned to `soroban-sdk =
"20.0.0"` while the other 138 crates use `"25.0.2"`, and Cargo's workspace
resolver couldn't satisfy both simultaneously. **Fixed**: bumped all 8 to
`25.0.2`, matching the rest of the workspace. This was a mechanical,
low-risk fix (all 8 are stub crates with no real logic depending on the old
API surface).

After that fix: **149 of 151 crates compile clean** (`cargo check
--workspace`). Two do not:

- `badge-minter` — uses `#[contractevent]` / `#[topic]`, which don't exist
  in whatever soroban-sdk version this crate's dependency actually resolves
  to (`E0432: unresolved import`). Needs its Cargo.toml checked against the
  workspace's `25.0.2` and its event-emission code updated to match that
  version's API.
- `season-rewards-vault` — same `#[contractevent]`/`#[topic]` issue, plus a
  `#[contractimpl]` function taking a `usize` parameter, which Soroban's
  contract macro doesn't support (needs `u32`/`u64`/etc).

Neither was touched in this pass — they're real code-level fixes, not
mechanical version bumps, and deserve their own PR with tests.

## The 12 contracts proposed for v1

Per `ANTIGRAVITY-BUILD-PROMPT.md`. Current classification, not aspirational:

| Contract | Status | What's needed for v1 |
|---|---|---|
| `random-generator` | implemented | Already has 32 tests — review for the provably-fair RNG design, add fuzz/property tests |
| `treasury` | implemented | 13 tests — review access control paths |
| `quest-ledger-v2` | implemented | 4 tests — review edge cases (streak resets, double-claims) |
| `access-control` | partial | Real RBAC logic, **zero tests** — write the test suite before calling this v1-ready |
| `coin-flip` | partial | Real logic (exposure tracking, recent-game history), zero tests |
| `dice-roll` | partial | Zero tests |
| `higher-lower` | partial | Zero tests; also currently **excluded from the workspace build** — check why before adding tests |
| `number-guess` | partial | 1 open TODO, zero tests |
| `trivia-game` | partial | 2 open TODOs, 3 tests — close the TODOs |
| `pattern-puzzle` | partial | 1022 lines, 13 tests, 4 open TODOs — closest to done of the partials, resolve the TODOs |
| `prize-pool` | partial | Zero tests — this contract moves money, treat the missing tests as a blocker, not a nice-to-have |
| `leaderboard` | partial (manually reclassified) | The heuristic flagged this as a stub over one placeholder comment on a batch-update helper; the bulk of the contract (score submission, ranking) is real. Zero tests either way. |

**None of the 12 are "implemented" in the sense of "done, tested,
production-ready."** Three have real test coverage and should be reviewed
rather than rewritten; the other nine have real logic but need a test suite
before anyone should call them v1-ready. That is the honest state of this
list, not a downgrade from the build prompt's plan — the plan already said
"bring those to production quality," this file is what "not yet at that
quality" looks like concretely.

## On the "move non-v1 contracts to contracts/incubator/" idea

`ANTIGRAVITY-BUILD-PROMPT.md` proposed physically moving the ~139
non-shortlisted crates into `contracts/incubator/`. **Not done in this
pass.** This repo has a live 960-commit history, two remotes, and an
existing (now-fixed) workspace `Cargo.toml` with an explicit `members` list
and `exclude` list that CI presumably depends on. Moving 139 directories is
a large, mechanical, hard-to-cleanly-revert change with real risk of
breaking CI or in-flight branches, for a benefit (tidier directory listing)
that doesn't require the move — `STATUS.md`'s table above gives the same
signal without touching the working tree structure at all. If a maintainer
wants the physical move later, this file's classification is the input list
for it.

## Full classification

Machine-generated from the scan above. `?` in the Tests column means
`#[test]` blocks weren't found by the grep (again: a proxy, not proof of
coverage).
